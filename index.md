This is the documentation for GesturePointer tool. The tool uses RGB-D stream and [OpenPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08008)-based pose estimation node developed in [OpenDR project](https://github.com/opendr-eu/opendr) to localize and publish pointed targets as ROS topics. 

The tool was developed using ROS1 Noetic distribution; ROS2 Humble draft implementation exists but is yet to be released. The original work was developed for Intel RealSense D415 camera.
